# Go Web Scraper with AI Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates a web scraper built with Go that integrates with the Gemini API for AI-based content analysis. The application allows users to input a website URL, scrape its content, and then use AI to analyze and extract information based on user-defined queries.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Uses [Chromedp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/chromedp/chromedp) to navigate and scrape website content.
- **Content Extraction:** Extracts and cleans body content using [Goquery](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery).
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes [GenAI](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/generative-ai-go/genai) to process and analyze content based on user input.
- **User Interaction:** Prompts the user for a URL and description of the information they wish to extract.
